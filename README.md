## Routing feed

[Download](https://github.com/polettif/gtfs-test-feeds/raw/master/zip/routing.zip)

Simple feed to test routing between different stops. All routes have trips in just one direction. Some stops (1, 3 and 8) have parent stations. This image shows the `WEEK` service running on 2018-10-01.
